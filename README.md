# python
contains several examples of my python code:
* <code>chaosgame.py</code> plots the Sierpinski fractal
* <code>gui.py</code> uses Qt to create a user interface for inputting parameters for a simulation
* <code>simulationsDatabase.py</code> searches a folder hierarchy for specific files that contain simulation parameters, and then creates a simulations database with the contents of these files.
* The folder *Kaggle* contains notes and my solutions to exercises from the python and pandas courses from Kaggle. 
* The folder *Misc* contains miscellaneous notes, mostly about subjects related to machine learning.
