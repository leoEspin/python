# python
contains several examples of my python code:
* `nQueens.py` Uses backtraking to fill the n x n board with n queens in a way that the queens cannot attack each other. The progress of the solution is shown with an animation on the terminal, showing the current status of the solution at each step. 
* <code>chaosgame.py</code> plots the Sierpinski fractal
* <code>gui.py</code> uses Qt to create a user interface for inputting parameters for a simulation
* <code>simulationsDatabase.py</code> searches a folder hierarchy for specific files that contain simulation parameters, and then creates a simulations database with the contents of these files.
* `unitTest.py` tests the class `nameExtractor.py` 
* `generateIndex.py` searches for documentation files in the *docs* folder and adds the files to a list in the main documentation web page
* The folder *docs* contains miscellaneous notes about my [machine learning projects](https://leoespin.github.io/python/).
