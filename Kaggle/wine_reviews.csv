Rideau 2014 Estate Syrah,"Baked red cherry, crushed clove, iron and rose petals make for standard aromas on this bottling, although they are fairly light and simple here.

Dopff & Irion 2004 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace),"Medium-gold in color. Complex and inviting nose layered with a strong earthy minerality, vibrant bright fruit and intriguing notes of petrol and honey.

Very long, juicy, lingering finish.",France,Riesling
Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Prapó  (Barolo),"Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring.",Italy,Nebbiolo
Matrix 2007 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine.

Mauritson 2007 Rockpile Cemetary Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile),"Defines Rockpile Zinfandel in intensity of fruit and high alcohol which is in keeping with the volume. There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.",US,Zinfandel
Henry's Drive Vignerons 2006 Parson's Flat Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway),"The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018.",Australia,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon
Silverado 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Le Riche 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch),"Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.",South Africa,Cabernet Sauvignon

Give it three years and reap the benefits.",South Africa,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Brunate  (Barolo),"At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass.

Needs a few more years, but can be enjoyed now with a good deal of pleasure.",Italy,Nebbiolo
Dopff & Irion 2008 Gentil White (Alsace),"Attractive mid-gold color. Compelling layers of tangy citrus and stone fruit aromas with notes of honey and earthy minerality.

Taut and focused.",France,Alsace white blend
Delheim 2001 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch),"A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure.

Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2003  Barolo,"Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage.

Clark-Clauden 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.",US,Cabernet Sauvignon
Giacomo Ascheri 2001 Sorano  (Barolo),"The color is just beginning to show signs of browning at the edge, but the wine is still fresh and vibrant. The nose is complex, showing licorice, summer fruits, caramel and roses. On the palate, it is soft and pleasant, but lacks some concentration.  At its peak, but will drink well for a few years.",Italy,Nebbiolo
Lassègue 2003  Saint-Émilion,"This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune—no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer.

Imported by Acadia Imports.",France,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
Beaumont 2005 Hope Marguerite Chenin Blanc (Walker Bay),"This is great Chenin Blanc, wood fermented but still leaving all the varietal character.

Giacomo Ascheri 2003 Vigna dei Pola  (Barolo),"This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar.

Vincent Vineyards 2010 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas.

Vincent Vineyards 2012 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties.

The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.",US,Syrah
Carl Graff 2014 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here.

It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.",Germany,Riesling
Casa Santa Vitória 2013 Grande Reserva Tinto Red (Alentejano),"From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine.

Château Vincens 2012 Malbec (Cahors),"Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess.

TerraMater 2006 Unusual Cabernet-Shiraz-Zinfandel Red (Maipo Valley),"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors.

Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2003 Montenero Red (Sicilia),"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge—almost too much—emphasis on toasted oak.
